# How to host a resume on Github Pages
## What is this README?
This README describes the steps on how to host and format a resume using Markdown, a Markdown editor, GitHub Pages and Jekyll. These are the most common and popular software stacks.

I took inspiration from Andrew Etter by reading his book _Modern Technical Writing_. His book helped me ensure my README acts in accordance to the general principles of technical writing.
> According to Etter, documentation as such should be open-source and be written with an aim for other people to contribute to it.

This book goes in great detail and serves as a great source of knowledge for technical writing. I have included the link to the book under the [Additional resources](add link here) section.

## Requirements and necessities
Below are the some of the things you would require before proceeding:
- A resume formatted in Markdown.
- A Github account.
- Install Jekyll on your computer.

> According to Etter's Modern Technical Writing, he emphasizes on the use of Lightweight Markup Languages such as Markdown or AsciiDoc (for linux users) since they are easy to learn and are human-readable in its raw form as well.

See [Additional resources] add link here for links to Markdown tutorial, Github tutorial and Jekyll installation.

## Instructions

Having learnt basics of Markdown and having created a Github account,  you can now begin by searching for static website themes supported by Github pages and Jekyll over the internet.

A couple of good themes have been linked under [additional resources.]add link here

> Etter describes in his book that static websites are easy to setup, secure and are fast. They do not have server side dependencies and therefore they are not generated dynamically.
